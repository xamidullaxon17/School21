## Chapter I

### Foreword

You are what you eat. Think about your body and organism as a system that needs
to get many different nutrients to live a happy and effective life. If it lacks
some nutrients, important chemical reactions may stop occurring and your health
will eventually fall apart.

Your diet should be balanced if you want to live healthily. You need proteins,
carbohydrates,and fats as well as Fe, Mg, Na, K, Ca, Zn, Se, Cr, I, vitamins
D, B12, E, C, A, K, Cu, etc. This is already a long list but it is far from being
exhausted. If you do not eat enough protein, your body will start looking for
them inside its own muscles, organs, and tissues. Eventually, you will lack
certain enzymes, hormones, transport proteins, immune cells, etc. If you eat
too much of them, your body will be intoxicated by decaying materials and your
health will again decrease. This applies to any item in the list. ‚ÄúPoison is
in everything, and no thing is without poison. The dosage makes it either a poison
or a remedy‚Äù.

The first problem is that our diet is not as diverse as is should be, if we
are talking about an average person in the Western world. How often do you eat
vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans, berries, bread, pastries, fish, meat, seaweed,
and butter? How often do you drink coffee, green tea, milk, alcohol, juices,
and smoothies?

The second problem is that we like to eat tasty things and none of this healthy
food is as tasty as fried fries, chips, etc. The third problem is that we do
not know enough good recipes.

What if we had an app that could predict how tasty a dish can be with the products
currently in our refrigerator, what nutrients it will contain and recommend
us a of recipes that are healthy and tasty at the same time?

### Instructions

* Use this page as your the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors or speculations
about how to prepare your solution.
* Here and further we use Python 3 as the only correct version of Python.
* The python files on for python exercises (module01, module02, module03) must
have the following block in the end: ```if __name__ == ‚Äò__main__‚Äô```.
* Pay attention to the permissions of your files and directories.
* To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
* Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine peers.
* You should not leave any file your directory other than those explicitly specified
by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your .gitignore to
avoid accidents.
* Your solution must be in your GIT repository for evaluation. Always push only to the develop branch! The master branch will be ignored. Work in the src directory.
* When you need to get precise output in your programs, it is forbidden to display a
precalculated output instead of performing the exercise correctly.
* Have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. If that fails, try with your
neighbor on the left.
* Your reference material: mates / Internet / Google.
* You can ask questions in Slack.
* Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
* And may the Force be with you!

## Chapter III

### Specific instructions for the day

* No code in the global scope of the main program. Use the classes and methods that
you have written in the development stage!
* Any exception not caught will invalidate your work, even in the event of an error
that you were asked to test.
* The interpreter to use is Python 3
* All built-in functions are is allowed

## Chapter IV

### Mandatory part

In this rush, you are going to work on your own application that will help
people to eat healthier and tastier food. It is a good and valuable experience to
create a product prototype out of the different technologies that you have studied.
This will be a pretty result for just two weeks of diving in Python and data science!

Your work will have three stages: research (work in a Notebook), development
(organizing everything in a module with classes and methods), and the program
itself (python script). Each of the stages will produce corresponding files
as a result.

#### Main program

Let us start from the end. The program is a Python script (```nutritionist.py```).

* It takes in a list of ingredients.
* It forecasts and returns the rating class (bad, so-so, great) of a potential dish with
the ingredients.
* It finds and returns all the nutrients (proteins, fats, sodium, etc.) in the ingredients
as well as their daily values in %.
* It finds 3 the most similar recipes to the list of ingredients, their ratings, and the
URLs where a user can find the full details.

Here is an example:

```
$ ./nutritionist.py milk, honey, jam
I. OUR FORECAST
You might find it tasty, but in our opinion, it is a bad idea to have a
dish with that list of ingredients.
II. NUTRITION FACTS
Milk
Protein - 6% of Daily Value
Total Carbohydrate - 1% of Daily Value
Total Fat - 1% of Daily Value
Calcium - 12% of Daily Value
...
Honey
...
Jam
...
III. TOP-3 SIMILAR RECIPES:
- Strawberry-Soy Milk Shake, rating: 3.0, URL:
https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/strawberry-soy-milk-
shake-239217
- ...
- ...
```

#### Development

You need to create a Python module (```recipes.py```) with the classes and
methods that are used in the main script.

#### Research

In this part of the rush, you need to prepare everything that is used
in the classes and methods above in a Jupyter Notebook (recipes.ipynb).

* Forecast
  * Data preparation 
    * Use [the dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hzmxNBrY7-9mv5EpqAvhVUiJahfrcYUN/view?usp=sharing) from Epicurious collected by HugoDarwood. 
    * Filter the columns: the less non-ingredient columns in your
dataset the
better. You will predict the rating or rating category using only the ingredients and nothing else. 
  * Regression 
    * Try different algorithms and their hyperparameters for rating
prediction.
Choose the best on cross-validation and find the score (RMSE) on the test
subsample. 
    * Try different ensembles and their hyperparameters. Choose the
best on
cross-validation and find the score on the test subsample. 
    * Calculate the RMSE for a naive regressor that predicts the
average rating. 
  * Classification 
    * Binarize the target column by rounding the ratings to the closest
integer.
This will be your classes. 
    * Try different algorithms and their hyperparameters for class
prediction.
Choose the best on cross-validation and find the score (accuracy) on the
test subsample. 
    * Compare the metrics using accuracy. Calculate the accuracy of a
naive
classificator that predicts the most common class.
    * Binarize the target column again by converting the integers to
classes ‚Äòbad‚Äô
(0, 1), ‚Äòso-so‚Äô (2, 3), ‚Äògreat‚Äô (4, 5). 
    * Try different algorithms and their hyperparameters for class
prediction.
Choose the best on cross-validation and find the score on the test subsample. 
    * Compare the metrics using accuracy. Calculate the accuracy of a
naive
classificator that predicts the most common class. 
    * What is worse: to predict a bad rating which is good in real life, or
to
predict a good rating which is bad in real life? Replace accuracy with the
appropriate metric. 
    * Try different algorithms and their hyperparameters for class
prediction
with the new metric. Choose the best and find the score on the test
subsample. 
    * Try different ensembles and their hyperparameters. Choose the
best and
find the score on the test subsample.
  * Decision
    * Decide what is better to use: the regression model or the
classification.
Save the best model. You will use it in the program.
* Nutrition Facts
  * Collect all the nutrition facts for the ingredients from your prepared and filtered dataset (only ingredient columns) into a dataframe. Use [the following API](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html) for that. 
  * Transform all the values into % of the daily value. Keep only nutrients that
exist in [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jn0t5tU_RgOpq4wcO-uS4D0_NAP6MwHz/view?usp=sharing) and [that](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bmdZGB0QwND2BD3XlC1JswL7AdnTJHLT/view?usp=sharing) table. 
  * Save the transformed dataframe into a CSV file that you will use in your main
program 
* Similar Recipes 
  * For each recipe from the dataset, collect the URL from epicurious.com with
  its details (if there is no URL for that recipe, skip it).
  * Save the new dataframe to a CSV file that you will use in your main program.

## Chapter V

### Bonus part

Add more methods to the classes that will help the script perform a new
function: generate a menu for a day.

The daily menu should randomly give a list of the three recipes that
cover most of the nutritional needs (% of the daily value) without
overtaking them and have the highest total rating.

You should offer only recipes appropriate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner,
respectively.

The result of the program should look like this:

```
BREAKFAST
---------------------
Feta, Spinach, and Basil Omelette Muffins (rating: 4.375)
Ingredients:
- arugula
- egg
- feta
- muffin
- omelet
- spinach
- tomato
Nutrients:
- protein: 16%
- fat: 10%
- sodium: 7 %

## Chapter VI

### Turn-in and peer-evaluation

Turn in your work using your git repository, as usual.

Only the work that is in your repository will be graded during the evaluation.

During the correction, you will be evaluated on your turn-in as well
as your ability to present, explain, and justify your choices.
