## _Traveling Salesman Problem_

In this team project you will use SQL to solve the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). You will learn to model graphs and routes, create tables with nodes and travel costs, and write queries to find the cheapest paths and analyze the results.

These skills will help you with optimization, data analysis, and building information systems—valuable in business analytics, software development, and IT infrastructure management.

## How to learn at «School 21»
1. «School 21» might feel different from your previous educational experiences. It emphasizes high autonomy: you’re given a task, and you must complete it. Throughout the course, you are expected to delve deeper into the subject and solve problems. Use all available means to find information—the resources of the internet are limitless. Be mindful of your sources (for example, if you use AI tools): verify, think, analyze, and compare.
2. You will need to present your solution to other students and receive feedback from them. Peer-to-peer (P2P) learning is a process where students exchange knowledge and experience, simultaneously acting as both mentors and learners. This way you can learn not only from materials but also from each other.
3. Don’t hesitate to ask for help: around you are peers who are also navigating this path for the first time. Likewise, don’t be afraid to respond to requests for help—your experience is valuable and useful, so share it openly with others. Join RocketChat to stay updated with the latest community announcements.
4. Your learning will be meaningless if you simply copy others’ solutions. If you receive help, always make sure you fully understand the why, how, and purpose behind it. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes.
5. If you’re stuck on something and feel like you’ve tried everything but still don’t know what to do—just take a break! Believe it or not, this advice has helped many professionals in their work. Step away, clear your mind, and the right solution might just come to you next time!
6. The learning process is just as important as the result. It’s not just about solving the task—it’s about understanding how to solve it.

How to work with the project: 
1. Before starting, clone the project from GitLab into a repository of the same name.
2. All code files must be created in the src/ folder of the cloned repository.
3. After cloning, create a develop branch and push changes to it in GitLab. Push to GitLab in the develop branch as well.

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![T00_01](misc/images/T00_01.png)

Given a finite number of "cities" and the cost of travel between each pair of cities, find the cheapest way to visit all the cities and return to your starting point. (In the illustration, the Procter & Gamble company held a contest in 1962. The contest required solving a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a given set of 33 cities. There was a tie among several participants who found the optimal solution. One of the winners was an early TSP researcher, Professor Gerald Thompson from Carnegie Mellon University.)

The travel costs are symmetric in the sense that traveling from city X to city Y costs the same as traveling from city Y to city X. The "way to visit all the cities" refers simply to the order in which the cities are visited. In other words, the data consist of integer weights assigned to the edges of a finite complete graph; the goal is to find a Hamiltonian cycle (i.e., a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting point) with the minimum total weight. In this context, Hamiltonian cycles are commonly called tours.

The origins of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) are unclear. In the 1920s, mathematician and economist Karl Menger published it among his colleagues in Vienna. In the 1930s, the problem resurfaced in mathematical circles at Princeton. In the 1940s, it was studied by statisticians (Mahalanobis (1940), Jessen (1942), Ghosh (1948), Marks (1948)) in connection with an agricultural application. The mathematician Merrill Flood later popularized it among his colleagues at the RAND Corporation. Eventually, the TSP became known as a prototype of a difficult problem in combinatorial optimization: examining all tours one by one was out of the question due to their vast number, and for a long time, no alternative solution approaches emerged.

## Chapter II
## Rules of the day

- Make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- It is perfectly fine if you use the IDE to write source code (aka SQL script).
- You should not leave any files in your directory other than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore' to avoid accidents. 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely anything can be represented in SQL! Let's get started and have fun!

![T00_02](misc/images/T00_02.png)

This is a team project. Take a look at the Graph. 
There are 4 cities (a, b, c and d) and arcs between them with costs (or taxes). Actually, the cost is (a,b) = (b,a).

Please create a table with named nodes using structure {point1, point2, cost} and fill data based on a picture (remember there are direct and reverse paths between 2 nodes).
Please write a SQL statement that returns all tours (aka paths) with minimum travel cost if we start from city "a".
Remember, you need to find the cheapest way to visit all cities and return to your starting point. For example, the tour looks like a -> b -> c -> d -> a.

Below is an example of the output data. Please sort the data by total_cost and then by tour.

| total_cost | tour |
| ------ | ------ |
| 80 | {a,b,d,c,a} |
| ... | ... |

## Exercise 01 — Opposite TSP

Please add a way to see additional rows with the most expensive cost to the SQL from the previous exercise. Take a look at the sample data below. Please sort the data by total_cost and then by tour.

| total_cost | tour |
| ------ | ------ |
| 80 | {a,b,d,c,a} |
| ... | ... |
| 95 | {a,d,c,b,a} |
