## _Continuing to JOIN and make change in data_

In this project you will learn how to extract data from a database using complex SQL queries and modify it with Data Manipulation Language (DML).

These skills are essential if you're aiming to become a database specialist, analyst, developer, or business analyst.

The ability to efficiently retrieve and modify data will be valuable when developing inventory systems, analyzing sales, personalizing services, or creating reports and dashboards.

## How to learn at «School 21»
1. «School 21» might feel different from your previous educational experiences. It emphasizes high autonomy: you’re given a task, and you must complete it. Throughout the course, you are expected to delve deeper into the subject and solve problems. Use all available means to find information—the resources of the internet are limitless. Be mindful of your sources (for example, if you use AI tools): verify, think, analyze, and compare.
2. You will need to present your solution to other students and receive feedback from them. Peer-to-peer (P2P) learning is a process where students exchange knowledge and experience, simultaneously acting as both mentors and learners. This way you can learn not only from materials but also from each other.
3. Don’t hesitate to ask for help: around you are peers who are also navigating this path for the first time. Likewise, don’t be afraid to respond to requests for help—your experience is valuable and useful, so share it openly with others. Join RocketChat to stay updated with the latest community announcements.
4. Your learning will be meaningless if you simply copy others’ solutions. If you receive help, always make sure you fully understand the why, how, and purpose behind it. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes.
5. If you’re stuck on something and feel like you’ve tried everything but still don’t know what to do—just take a break! Believe it or not, this advice has helped many professionals in their work. Step away, clear your mind, and the right solution might just come to you next time!
6. The learning process is just as important as the result. It’s not just about solving the task—it’s about understanding how to solve it.

How to work with the project: 
1. Before starting, clone the project from GitLab into a repository of the same name.
2. All code files must be created in the src/ folder of the cloned repository.
3. After cloning, create a develop branch and push changes to it in GitLab. Push to GitLab in the develop branch as well.

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D03_01](misc/images/D03_01.png)

Relation Theory is a mathematical foundation for modern Relational Databases. Every aspect of databases has a corresponding mathematical and logical justification. Including INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE operators. (Dr. Edgar Frank Codd is in the picture).

How the INSERT operator works from a mathematical point of view.

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`INSERT rel RELATION {TUPLE {A INTEGER(4),B INTEGER(4),C STRING ('Hello') }};` | You can use mathematical INSERT statements and integrate “tuple” construction to convert an incoming data to row. |
| From the other side, you can use explicit assignment with the UNION operator. | `rel:=rel UNION RELATION {TUPLE {A INTEGER(4), B INTEGER (7), C STRING ('Hello')}};` |

What’s about the DELETE statement?

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`DELETE rel WHERE A = 1;` | If you want to delete a row for A = 1, you can do it in a direct way. |
| ... or by using a new assignment without key A = 1 | `rel:=rel WHERE NOT (A = 1);` |

... and finally UPDATE statement. Also there are 2 cases.

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`UPDATE rel WHERE A = 1 {B:= 23*A, C:='String #4'};` | Update statement from mathematical point of view |
| New assignment for relation variable rel based on CTE and working with Sets | `rel:=WITH (rel WHERE A = 1) AS T1, (EXTEND T1 ADD (23*A AS NEW_B, 'String #4' AS NEW_C)) AS T2, T2 {ALL BUT B,C} AS T3, (T3 RENAME (NEW _B AS B, NEW _C AS C)) AS T4: (S MINUS T1) UNION T4;` |

The last case with UPDATE statement is really interesting, because in other words you add a new tuple and after that make a MINUS of the old row. Same behavior in the physical implementation! Actually, `UPDATE = DELETE + INSERT` and there is a special term "Tombstone" status for a particular deleted/updated row. Then if you have a lot of Tombstones then you have a bad TPS metric and you need to control your dead data!

Let’s make a cheese of our data! :-)


## Chapter II
## Rules of the day

- Make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- It is perfectly fine if you use the IDE to write source code (aka SQL script).
- You should not leave any files in your directory other than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore' to avoid accidents. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely anything can be represented in SQL! Let's get started and have fun!

Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of pizzeria
- field rating — average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field name — name of person
- field age — age of person
- field gender — gender of person
- field address — address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id — primary key
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name — name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price — price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id — foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id — primary key
- field person_id — foreign key to person
- field menu_id — foreign key to menu
- field order_date — date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Find the union of pizzerias that have received orders exclusively from females and those that have received orders exclusively from males. In other words, identify the sets of pizzerias ordered only by females and only by males, then perform a UNION operation on these sets. Note that the term "only" applies strictly to each gender group. When using set operators (UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT), do not include duplicates. Sort the results by the name of the pizzeria. Sample data is provided below.



| pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | 
| Papa Johns |
