Dear Boss,
Thank you for trusting me with this task. I will do my best to complete it accurately.
Could you please clarify the deadline for correcting the typo in the program interface?
Also, I have a few questions to make sure I understand everything correctly:
Which part of the interface contains the typo?
Do you have a preferred wording for the correction?
Should I prepare any additional documentation or report after making the change?
I appreciate your guidance and look forward to your reply.
Best regards,
Xamidullaxon Akromov
