### Letter to My Manager Requesting a Feedback Meeting
    Hello Boss,
    I hope you are well.
    I would like to ask for a short meeting to get feedback about my work. It will help me understand my progress and improve my skills.
    Can we plan a time for this feedback meeting? Maybe this week or next week?
    Thank you very much for your time and help!
    Best regards,
    Xamidullaxon Akromov
