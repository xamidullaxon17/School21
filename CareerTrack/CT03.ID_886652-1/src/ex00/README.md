1. **Tell us about your projects that didn't work out. What did you learn from them?**
    - In one project, I tried to build a machine learning model to predict movie ratings. The model did not work well because I used too small a dataset and did not clean the data correctly. From this, I learned that data quality is very important and it is better to check the data carefully before training models.

2. **If you are employed at the time of the interview, prepare for the question "Why do you want to leave your company?" If you are not employed at the time of the interview, you may be asked "Why did you leave the company?"**
    - I am a student and I have no official work experience. I am now ready to start my first job and use my skills in real projects. I want to grow as a professional Data Scientist.

3. **What do you like about your job?**
    - I enjoy analyzing data and finding patterns. I like when I can show clear results in graphs and help people make better decisions. Also, I like learning new tools and working on different types of data.

4. **Please give me an example of a conflicting work situation. How did you resolve it?**
    - During a team project at my bootcamp, we had different opinions about which model to use. I listened to all ideas and suggested to test each model and compare the results. This way, we found the best solution and finished the project successfully. I think clear communication helps to solve conflicts.

5. **What made you interested in the company/job?**
    - I am interested in this job because your company works on innovative projects and uses modern technologies in data analysis. I want to learn from professional teams and develop my skills. Also, I like that your company has a culture of growth and learning.
