Dear Team,

My name is Xamidullaxon Akromov, and today is my first day as a Data Scientist here at Google.

I am excited to join you and contribute to our projects. My background is in mathematics and data analysis. I have experience working with Python, Pandas, SQL, Tableau, and other tools. Before joining Google, I completed data science projects on Kaggle and other online platforms where I learned how to analyze big datasets and build useful reports.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing football. If anyone likes football too, I would be happy to play together sometime!

I am looking forward to getting to know everyone and working together on our goals. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to connect.

I look forward to being of service to the company and to you.

Best regards,
Xamidullaxon Akromov
