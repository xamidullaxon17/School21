This is a simple test file.
It contains multiple lines of text.
Each line has a word or a phrase.
grep is a powerful tool used for searching text.
Testing options like -e, -i, -v, -c, and more.
grep -i will ignore case sensitivity.
The -v option inverts the search, showing lines that do not match.
The -o option only shows the matched part of the line.
The -c option counts the number of lines that match.
There are many combinations of options for grep to explore.
Let's test multiple options together.
grep -e allows searching with a regular expression.
Make sure the pattern matches words in the test file.
Patterns like grep, test, and more are included in this file.
Good luck testing your grep command with this file.
